# E-Commerce Microservices Deployment with AWS EKS & CI/CD

## Overview

This project demonstrates a scalable, cloud-native deployment of an **E-commerce microservices application** using **AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**. The system is fully containerized with **Docker**, orchestrated using **Kubernetes**, and deployed through an automated **CI/CD pipeline** built with **Jenkins** or **GitLab CI**. The backend is powered by **Amazon RDS**, and robust monitoring is achieved using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**. Infrastructure provisioning is handled using **Terraform**.

---

### Components

- **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)**:  
  EKS, EC2, RDS, VPC, S3, IAM, Route 53

- **Microservices**:
  -  User Service
  -  Product Service
  -  Order Service

- **Containerization**: Docker  
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (EKS)  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins or GitLab CI with Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm  
- **Database**: Amazon RDS (MySQL or PostgreSQL)  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus & Grafana  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform  

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools and accounts are set up before starting:

-  An active AWS Account
-  Docker installed and running
- `kubectl` installed and configured for your EKS cluster
-  AWS CLI installed and authenticated
-  Jenkins or GitLab CI for CI/CD
-  Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
-  Familiarity with **Python (Flask/Django)** or **Java (Spring Boot)** for developing microservices

---

## Key Features

- End-to-end CI/CD pipeline with automated deployment to AWS EKS
- Modular microservices architecture with containerized services
- Secure and scalable infrastructure managed via Terraform
- Real-time monitoring and visualization with Prometheus and Grafana
- Cloud-native best practices applied throughout the stack

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add auto-scaling policies via Kubernetes HPA
- Implement service mesh with Istio
- Add log aggregation with ELK or Loki
- Enable multi-region failover
